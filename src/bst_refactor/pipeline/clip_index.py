"""Clip-stem to mp4-path index for video-loading Datasets.

The clips dir keeps its ``{split}/{Top,Bottom}_{stroke_type}/*.mp4`` layout
after Phase 2 of the dir-flatten refactor (flattening the .mp4 tree itself
is deferred to Phase 3, which is indefinitely parked). Any CSV-driven
``Dataset`` that needs to load video frames should rglob once at
``__init__`` via the helper below and use the returned dict for O(1)
per-sample lookup rather than walking the tree per ``__getitem__``.

Expected consumers (not in-repo yet):
- Arch 2 3D CNN video Dataset.
- Arch 1 wrist-crop Dataset that pairs pose-derived wrist coords with
  cropped video frames.

Both should pair the returned lookup with a split + label derivation
driven by ``notebooks/clips_master.csv``, the same way
``collate_npy`` does for the pose + shuttle npys.

    Transparent to the nested {split}/{class}/ layout: we emit one entry

    clip_stem to pick train/val/test membership + label per the active

# MMPose pose extraction: changes and pipeline context

This directory bridges the pipeline's clip output and BST's expected input format. The pose extraction code in `prepare_train_on_shuttleset.py` runs MMPose on ~33k short clips to produce per-clip skeleton keypoints, court positions, and shuttle trajectories.

---

## Summary of changes vs original BST

The MMPose integration is almost entirely unchanged from the [original BST repo](https://github.com/YuanGao-James/Badminton_Stroke_Timing_Classification). Every function in the pose processing chain is **byte-identical** to the original. Two targeted fixes were added, plus non-functional improvements (docstrings, imports, comments).

### Changes that affect runtime behavior

#### 1. Shuttle/pose decoupling + frame count alignment (refactor + bugfix)

**Problem**: The original code read shuttle CSVs inside the pose estimation step and saved `_shuttle.npy` per clip. This created two issues:

1. A missing or corrupt shuttle CSV would silently skip pose extraction for that clip entirely, since the resume check (`if not _shuttle.npy exists`) was gated on shuttle data rather than pose data.
2. MMPose and TrackNetV3 use different video backends that can disagree by 1-2 frames on the same `.mp4`, causing an `IndexError` when applying the failed-frame mask:

```python
# Original -- crashes with IndexError when len(failed_ls) != len(shuttle_result)
shuttle_result[failed_ls, :] = 0
```

**Fix**: Shuttle CSV reading was moved out of the pose step entirely and into `collate_npy()` (Step 3). The pose step now saves `_failed.npy` (a bool array marking frames where MMPose failed to detect 2 players) instead of `_shuttle.npy`. The resume check uses `_failed.npy`.

Temporal alignment and failed-frame masking now happen in `collate_npy()`:

```python
min_t = min(len(failed), len(shuttle))
if min_t < len(failed) or min_t < len(shuttle):
    joints_ls[i] = joints_ls[i][:min_t]
    pos_ls[i] = pos_ls[i][:min_t]
    shuttle = shuttle[:min_t]
    failed = failed[:min_t]
if np.any(failed):
    shuttle[failed, :] = 0
```

**Why tail-truncation, not centering**: Both decoders start at frame 0 and agree on early frames -- the disagreement is about whether the last 1-2 frames are valid (partial frames, B-frame dependencies). Tail-truncation preserves the 1:1 correspondence between `joints[i]` and `shuttle[i]` for all kept frames.

**Why shuttle reading belongs in collation**: Shuttle CSVs are taxonomy- and split-agnostic physical measurements that live in a single canonical directory (`ShuttleSet/shuttle_csv/`). Keeping them out of the pose step means the 1.5-3 day GPU job has no dependency on CSV availability, and collation (fast, re-runnable) can be re-run cheaply when the taxonomy changes without redoing pose extraction.

**Impact**: Loses at most 1-2 frames from the end of a 75-105 frame clip. No effect on clips where frame counts match (the vast majority).

#### 2. GPU memory cleanup between clips

Added `gc.collect()` + `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` after each clip in both the 2D and 3D pose loops.

**Why**: MMPose runs RTMDet + RTMPose on the GPU. Over ~33k clips, unreferenced GPU tensors can fragment CUDA's memory pool. Periodic cleanup prevents gradual accumulation.

**Risk**: Zero. `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` only frees genuinely unreferenced memory -- the MMPoseInferencer's model weights remain on GPU. CuDNN workspace caching is separate and unaffected. Performance cost is ~30-60 seconds total over 33k clips.

**Likelihood of being needed**: Low for this workload. MMPose's allocation pattern is highly uniform (same models, same-ish input, 2-4 people per frame), and PyTorch's caching allocator handles uniform patterns well. This is insurance, not a fix for an observed problem.

### Non-functional changes

- Added module-level docstring (lines 1-11)
- Added docstring to `prepare_2d_dataset_npy_from_raw_video()`
- Import path changes for `pipeline.config` integration
- `sys.path` setup for running as `python -m preparing_data.prepare_train_on_shuttleset`
- Expanded comment on the 3D inferencer per-clip reload bug workaround (lines 320-326)
- Refactored `detect_players_2d()` from nested if-else to early-return with `continue` (functionally identical)

## MMPose model and configuration

| Aspect | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Inferencer | `MMPoseInferencer('human')` |
| Resolved models | RTMDet-nano person detector (~30 MB) + RTMPose-L pose estimator (~250 MB) |
| MMPose version | 1.3.2 (pinned in `requirements.txt`) |
| Keypoint format | COCO 17-joint |
| Input | Raw `.mp4` file path (no preprocessing) |
| Frame processing | Per-frame via generator (always, see note below) |
| 2D inferencer lifecycle | Loaded once, reused across all clips |
| 3D inferencer lifecycle | Reloaded per clip (MMPose bug workaround -- see lines 320-326) |

**Frame-level batching is not possible**: MMPoseInferencer accepts a `batch_size` parameter, but MMPose 1.3.2's top-down pipeline **ignores it**. `BaseMMPoseInferencer.preprocess()` overrides MMEngine's `BaseInferencer.preprocess()` (which does implement batching via `_get_chunk_data`) with a method that processes one frame at a time regardless of the `batch_size` value. The source explicitly comments `# only supports inference with batch size 1`. The only batching that occurs is automatic: multiple detected people's crops within a single frame are collated into one RTMPose forward pass. Bypassing the inferencer API for manual frame batching would require ~100+ lines of new code for unclear benefit — RTMDet-nano is fast (~5-10ms/frame) and RTMPose crops are already batched per-frame.

### Call chain

```
prepare_train_on_shuttleset.py    main() dispatches 3 steps
    |
    Step 2:  prepare_2d_dataset_npy_from_raw_video()
    |            |
    |            +-- MMPoseInferencer('human')    loaded once
    |            |
    |            +-- detect_players_2d()           per clip
    |            |       |
    |            |       +-- inferencer(video_path)    per-frame generator
    |            |       +-- check_pos_in_court()      filter to 2 on-court players

                 |
                 +-- load _joints.npy, _pos.npy, _failed.npy (ThreadPoolExecutor)
                 +-- per clip: get_shuttle_result() from ShuttleSet/shuttle_csv/
                 |             tail-truncate to align MMPose/TrackNetV3 frame counts
                 |             zero shuttle coords where _failed is True
                 +-- pad_and_augment_one_npy_video() per clip (ProcessPoolExecutor)
                 +-- np.stack() all clips into batch arrays
                 +-- save {pose_style}.npy per --pose-styles (default: JnB_bone.npy), ...
```

### Per-clip processing detail

For each clip, `detect_players_2d()`:
1. Iterates MMPose's generator frame by frame
2. Extracts keypoints `(m, 17, 2)` and bboxes `(m, 4)` per frame
3. Requires >= 2 detected people; exactly 2 with feet projecting inside court
4. Orders players top-before-bottom by court y-coordinate
5. Normalizes joints relative to bounding box (or video height)
6. Returns `failed_ls`, `players_positions (t, 2, 2)`, `players_joints (t, 2, 17, 2)`

### Output format per clip

Files land flat under `save_root_dir`, one set per clip stem. Split and label assignment come from `notebooks/clips_master.csv` at collation time, not from the on-disk directory layout. See `scripts/dir_flatten_refactor.md` for the flatten refactor.

| File | Shape | Contents |
|------|-------|----------|
| `{clip_stem}_joints.npy` | `(F, 2, 17, 2)` or `(F, 2, 17, 3)` | Normalized joint keypoints (2D or 3D) |
| `{clip_stem}_pos.npy` | `(F, 2, 2)` | Court-projected player positions |
| `{clip_stem}_failed.npy` | `(F,)` bool | True where MMPose failed to detect 2 players |

Shuttle data (`*_shuttle.npy`) is no longer saved per-clip by the pose step. It is read from `ShuttleSet/shuttle_csv/` and merged at collation time (Step 3).

### Resume logic

`prepare_2d_dataset_npy_from_raw_video()` checks for an existing `_failed.npy` before processing each clip. `_failed.npy` is saved last, so its presence means all three outputs (`_pos`, `_joints`, `_failed`) are complete. Safe to re-run after crashes.

## Accuracy guarantees

No accuracy-affecting changes were made. Specifically:

- **MMPose model and call**: identical (`MMPoseInferencer('human')`, `show=False`, `batch_size=1`)
- **Input to MMPose**: raw `.mp4` path, no preprocessing, no resizing, no cropping
- **Keypoint extraction**: same `result['predictions'][0]` access pattern
- **Player filtering**: same >=2 people check, same court projection, same 2-player-on-court requirement
- **Player ordering**: same top-before-bottom by court y-coordinate
- **Joint normalization**: same `normalize_joints()` with identical args
- **Court projection**: same homography chain (`scale_pos_by_resolution` -> `convert_homogeneous` -> `project` -> `normalize_position`)
- **Shuttle normalization**: same `normalize_shuttlecock()`
- **Frame alignment fix**: only trims 1-2 tail frames that one decoder doesn't see; kept frames are unmodified
- **Memory cleanup**: only frees unreferenced GPU memory; does not affect model weights or inference results

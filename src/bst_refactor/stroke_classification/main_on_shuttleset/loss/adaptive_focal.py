"""Class-F1-driven adaptive focal loss for the imbalanced-difficulty regime.

Implements CDB-loss (Sinha et al. ACCV 2020 / IJCV 2022) with the per-class
difficulty signal swapped from held-out val accuracy to running train F1,
optionally composed with focal's ``(1 - p_t) ** gamma`` per-sample focusing
(Lin et al. ICCV 2017).

Loss shape, in plain English:
    per-class weight w_c = (1 - F1_running_c) ** tau
    per-sample loss      = - w_{c=label} * (1 - p_t) ** gamma * log(p_t)
    weights renormalised to mean 1.0 each epoch so the average loss scale
    stays comparable to uniform CE.

Train-loop responsibilities (see ``bst_train.train_one_epoch`` /
``train_network``):
    1. accumulate per-class TP / FP / FN during each epoch's forward pass,
    2. compute per-class F1 with ``per_class_f1_from_counts`` at end-of-epoch,
    3. call ``loss_fn.update_alpha(per_class_f1)`` once per epoch,
    4. (optional) read ``loss_fn.alpha`` for diagnostic logging.

``scratch/architecture_notes/class_f1_focal_design.md``.

class AdaptiveFocalLoss(nn.Module):
    """Adaptive focal loss with per-class alpha driven by running train F1.

    Forward signature mirrors ``nn.CrossEntropyLoss(reduction='mean')``: takes
    pre-softmax logits ``[B, n_classes]`` and integer labels ``[B]``, returns
    a scalar loss. The per-class weight vector ``alpha`` is held as a buffer
    so it persists across forward passes, moves with ``.to(device)``, and is
    saved in ``state_dict()``.

    During the first ``warm_up_epochs`` epochs the EMA still updates in the
    background but the forward pass uses uniform alpha, so the running F1
    estimate has time to absorb a few real readings before its shape starts
    driving the gradient.

    :param n_classes: size of the active class list (post-derive_active).
    :param class_names: parallel name list for diagnostic printouts; length
        must match ``n_classes``.
    :param tau: per-class aggressiveness exponent. ``tau=1.0`` uses ``1 - F1``
        directly; ``tau=2.0`` squares the gap.
    :param gamma: per-sample focal exponent on ``(1 - p_t)``. ``gamma=0`` is
        pure CDB (no focal modulation); ``gamma=1`` is the gentle default
        chosen for ShuttleSet's known label noise.
    :param momentum: EMA momentum on the running F1 estimate; ``momentum=0.9``
        gives a half-life of ~6.6 epochs (matches PyTorch BatchNorm and Adam
        first-moment convention).
    :param warm_up_epochs: epochs of uniform alpha at the start of training,
        before adaptive shape kicks in.
    :param f1_floor: lower clip on F1 readings before mapping to alpha. F1 is
        naturally bounded so the default 0.0 is fine; raise to ~0.05 only if
        a class flatlines and saturates alpha.
    :param device: device for the running buffers; defaults to CPU and gets
        moved by ``.to()`` like any other module.
